**Crops**: We obtained data including crops' best and worst **companion**s, planting periods (**farming_calendar**), and **crop info**rmation from two farming booklets*. The booklets provide qualitative information on which and how crops benefit each other. The planting period includes ranges of maximum and minimum temperatures (in °C) and ideal high and low temperatures (in °C) to plant, grow and cultivate crops. Crop information includes data on the optimal distance (in cm) between seeds/seedlings and the weeks of cultivation. 

We obtained data on crop **prices** for each month of the year from the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS: https://www.pcbs.gov.ps). We consulted local farmers to complete the missing data based on their experiences for the 38 crops analysed in this dashboard. 


**Weather**: We obtained the weather data from Visual Crossing (https://www.visualcrossing.com/weather/weather-data-services). The data describe the daily weather records for Jerusalem, Palestine. The data span 20 years from January 1, 2013, and include several weather features. For our scenario, we focus on four main features, which are the maximum temperature, minimum temperature, average temperature (in °C), and precipitation (in mm).
