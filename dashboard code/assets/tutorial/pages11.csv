You will now proceed to sign the Consent Form, then respond to a preliminary survey.
<br>
After that you will conduct the study by making up <b>ALL</b> decisions for the <b>Four</b> beds, followed by a survey. You will do this twice.
<br>
Please fill out all <b>Four</b> beds (main crop, companion,  Plant on 'week') before you click on 'Submit Decision'. The button will not work otherwise.
<br>
Keep in mind that sometimes you might get <b>guidance</b> at the bottom of the right panel. This guidance is <b>automatically</b> generated at some periods of the study.

Also, keep an eye for the periodic one-question surveys that pops up above it, and respond to it as it appears.
