We will walk you through the different tasks that you will be expected to perform throughout this study. We will acquaint you with the dashboard/visualization and the process of a planting decision-making.

In the email, you received a document that you can keep open as a reference when you navigate the visualization.

Furthermore, in the dashboard, you will have a textbox where you can take notes as you go through the different views. Please do not delete any of the notes you take, as we will be collecting them for analysis. You will also have a calculator to perform basic calculations to help you make your decisions.
